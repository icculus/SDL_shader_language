// !!! FIXME: Note that GCC produces an error for this, and we probably should, too:
// concat-operator-two-macros-with-args:2:17: error: pasting ")" and "y" does not give a valid preprocessing token
// But GCC still produces "RIGHT RIGHT" despite the error message.
// Also note that GCC's manual explicitly says:
//  "However, two tokens that don't together form a valid token cannot be
//   pasted together. For example, you cannot concatenate x with + in either
//   order. If you try, the preprocessor issues a warning and emits the two
//   tokens. Whether it puts white space between the tokens is undefined."
// So I consider it okay that we report "RIGHTRIGHT" here without the space.
#define y(a) a
#define x(a) y(a)##y(a)

x(RIGHT)
